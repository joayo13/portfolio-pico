This app was designed to easily get the top-rated place type you're looking for. It returns the highest rated place within what distance you'd like, using a bayesian weighted formula to get top-rated result. (same formula used by imdb to get their top-rated list). It's built with React and Typescript and uses Googles APIS to create the styled map and to get the places data.

If you want to, you can download it to your device to have a more native app-like experience as it's a PWA. Feel free to copy the source code and use it however you'd like, I have documented how you can set up for own project in my repo!
